    "\n",
    "### 1.1 Sequence Data Formats\n",
    "\n",
    "Nucleotide, protein, and reference genome sequences are stored in two plain-text formats widely used in bioinformatics: FASTA and FASTQ. We will discuss both file formats below and explore tools for working with data in these formats.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### FASTA Format\n",
    "\n",
    "FASTA is a plain text format and one of the simplest and most widely used formats for storing nucleotide, protein sequences, coding DNA sequences (CDS), transcript sequences, reference genome files, and so on. It originates from the FASTA alignment suite, created by [William R. Pearson](https://fasta.bioch.virginia.edu/wrpearson/) and [David J. Lipman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_J._Lipman).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Structure:**\n",
    "FASTA files are composed of sequence entries, each containing a description and the sequence data.\n",
    "- The description line (header line) starts with the greater than symbol `>` followed by a sequence identifier and description\n",
    "- Sequence data follows on subsequent lines and continues until there is another description line starting with `>`\n",

    "#### FASTQ Format\n",
    "\n",
    "FASTQ extends FASTA by including quality scores for each base. This is the standard output format for most sequencing data produced by modern high-throughput sequencing platforms. The per-base quality score indicates the confidence for each base call.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Structure (4 lines per read):**\n",
    "1. Header line starting with `@` followed by sequence identifier and other information\n",

    "The fastq or fasta files contains million of short/long reads from a high-throughput sequencer where their genomic position, function and consequences relative to the reference genome is not known. This is a result of digesting the nucleic acid during library preperation, where DNA or RNA is cut into a particular size, adapters are added and then loaded to be sequenced. There isn't a genomic sequencer that is capable of sequencing a genome on it's entire length, despite the fact that a good progress has been made with pore sequencing. However, reconstructing reads in respect to a genome reference is still required in a process commpnly known as alignemnt or mapping. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2 Alignment Formats\n",
    "\n",
    "#### SAM/BAM Format\n",
    "\n",
    "**SAM (Sequence Alignment/Map)** is a text format for storing sequence alignments. **BAM** is the compressed binary version.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key fields in SAM format:\n",
    "1. **QNAME**: Query (read) name\n",
    "2. **FLAG**: Bitwise flag (paired, mapped, strand, etc.)\n",
    "3. **RNAME**: Reference sequence name\n",
    "4. **POS**: 1-based leftmost mapping position\n",
    "5. **MAPQ**: Mapping quality\n",
    "6. **CIGAR**: Alignment description string\n",
    "7. **RNEXT**: Reference name of mate/next read\n",
    "8. **PNEXT**: Position of mate/next read\n",
    "9. **TLEN**: Template length\n",
    "10. **SEQ**: Segment sequence\n",
    "11. **QUAL**: Quality scores\n",
    "\n",
    "#### CRAM Format\n",
    "\n",
    "CRAM is a reference-based compressed columnar format for storing sequence alignments, developed as a more space-efficient alternative to BAM. It achieves 30-60% smaller file sizes through reference-based compression and advanced encoding schemes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Differences from BAM**\n",
    "**Reference dependency:** CRAM requires the reference genome (.fasta) for both reading and writing, as it stores only differences from the reference rather than full sequences.\n",
    "Compression modes: Supports both lossless (preserving all data) and lossy compression (discarding quality scores or other fields for additional space savings).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Storage architecture:** Uses columnar storage organized into containers and slices, rather than sequential read-by-read storage like SAM/BAM.\n",
    "\n",
    "**CRAM File Contents**\n",
    "\n",
    "CRAM files contain the same alignment information as SAM/BAM but organized differently:\n",
    "\n",
    "**File header:** SAM-compatible header including reference sequences, read groups, and program information, plus reference genome MD5 checksum for validation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Containers and slices:** Data organized into hierarchical containers (units of compression) containing slices (subsets of reads from specific genomic regions).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Alignment fields:** Same core fields as SAM/BAM:\n",
    "QNAME, FLAG, RNAME, POS, MAPQ, CIGAR\n",
    "RNEXT, PNEXT, TLEN\n",
    "SEQ (stored as differences from reference)\n",
    "QUAL (optionally preserved or discarded)\n",
    "Optional tags\n",

    "Generally, if you are working with a high preformance computing (HPC) to analyse youe bioinformatics data your system admin will be helping you with installing required bioinfomatics tools as most of them require a set of dependencies to be installed first. However, the bioinformatics comunity has made a use of a package managers such as [conda](https://anaconda.org/anaconda/conda) and containeried applications hosted in [Docker](https://www.docker.com/).
