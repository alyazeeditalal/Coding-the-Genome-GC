    "\n",
    "### 1.1 Sequence Data Formats\n",
    "\n",
    "Nucleotide, protein, and reference genome sequences are stored in two plain-text formats widely used in bioinformatics: FASTA and FASTQ. We will discuss both file formats below and explore tools for working with data in these formats.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### FASTA Format\n",
    "\n",
    "FASTA is a plain text format and one of the simplest and most widely used formats for storing nucleotide, protein sequences, coding DNA sequences (CDS), transcript sequences, reference genome files, and so on. It originates from the FASTA alignment suite, created by [William R. Pearson](https://fasta.bioch.virginia.edu/wrpearson/) and [David J. Lipman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_J._Lipman).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Structure:**\n",
    "FASTA files are composed of sequence entries, each containing a description and the sequence data.\n",
    "- The description line (header line) starts with the greater than symbol `>` followed by a sequence identifier and description\n",
    "- Sequence data follows on subsequent lines and continues until there is another description line starting with `>`\n",

    "#### FASTQ Format\n",

    "\n",

    "1. Header line starting with `@` followed by sequence identifier and other information\n",
